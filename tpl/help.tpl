    <ul>
      <li>Please DON'T make wallets with more Ether than you are willing to lose. This applies to all wallets and everything Ethereum while we are in Frontier.</li>
      <li>Please, DON'T forget to save your private key / password when you create a new wallet. Save them externally - not just on your computer! We wrote thorough instructions on this page</li>
      <li>Please DO make sure you are sending to the correct address.</li>
      <li>Please DO reach out to us (click contact above) with any and all feedback you have, especially little bugs, things that confused you, or error messages that don't make sense / have typos.</li>

    <p>MyEtherWallet.com and MyEtherWallet CX are not "web wallets". You do not create an account or give us your Ether to hold onto. All data is created on our computer/your browser, not our servers. It's not a website where you put your Ether and we store them for you. We just make it easy for you to save your wallet information in your browser/on your computer. Then we give you a place you to access that information and do stuff with it.</p>

  <h3> <span class="text-primary collapseButton">+</span> 0. I'm new. What do I do? </h3>
  <div class="collapsePanel collapsed">
    <p> MyEtherWallet.com gives you the ability to generate new wallets so you can store your Ether yourself, not on an exchange. This process happens entirely on your computer, not our servers. Therefore, when you generate a new wallet, <strong> you are responsible for safely backing it up.</strong>.
    <p> If you just purchased ETH on an exchange and want to hold it safely in your own wallet, or if you are using ShapeShift to exchange another from cryptocurrency, you will need to complete the following steps. These steps are outlined in detail in the questions below. Please read them all in full. </p>
    <p> Do not hesitate to <a id="contact" class="ptabs" showId="paneContact">reach out to us</a> if you have any questions. Remember, Ether now holds real monetary value and can be a significant investment. If you do not save your private key & password, there is no way to recover access to your wallet or the funds it holds.  I do not say this to scare you, only to remind you to be diligent, read carefully, and take your time during all the steps. But, if you follow the instructions found on this page, even a non-technical person can safely hold their Ether in a wallet. </p>

    <ol>
      <li> Create a new wallet. </li>
      <li> Back the wallet up.</li>
      <li> Verify you have access to this new wallet and have correctly saved all necessary information. </li>
      <li> Transfer Ether to this new wallet. </li>

  <ol>
    <li> Go to the <a id="generate-wallet" class="ptabs" showId="paneWalgen">"Generate Wallet"</a> tab.</li>

  <h3> <span class="text-primary collapseButton">+</span> 2a. How do I save/backup my wallet?</h3>
  <div class="collapsePanel collapsed">
  <p> You should always back up your wallet externally - like on a flash drive, in cloud storage (Dropbox, etc), and/or a piece of paper.</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Save the address. You can keep it to yourself or share it with others. That way, others can transfer ether to you. You may know this as your account # or public key.</li>
    <li> Save a version private key. Do not show it to anyone else. Your private key is necessary when you want to access your wallet to move it, spend it, or send it! There are 4 types of private keys:</li>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Private Key (encrypted): </strong> Text version of your private key. This is encrypted so you need the password you entered to use it. This is a safer way to save your key than unencrypted, but you need to remember your password.</li>
      <li><strong>JSON (encrypted): </strong> A JSON file is just a different format & contains some additional information. Some people prefer to have the text version & some prefer to have the JSON. If you are unsure, just save both. Again, this is encrypted so you will need your password.</li>
      <li><strong>Private Key (unencrypted): </strong> This is the unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no password is necessary. If someone were to find your unencrypted private key, they could access your wallet without a password. For this reason, encrypted private keys are typically recommended.</li>
      <li><strong>JSON (unencrypted): </strong> This is the unencrypted, JSON format of your private key. Again, this means you do not need the password but anyone who finds your JSON can access your wallet and your Ether without the password. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Place all this information in a folder, along with your JSON file, PDF version of your paper wallet, and whatever other information you would like to keep. Store it on your computer.</li>
    <li> Take this folder and place it on a USB drive. Store this USB drive in a place securely, in a separate location from your computer. Maybe that place is at your office (don't forget it when you're rich off Ether & ragequit!), at your parent's or another family member's house, in a storage locker, etc. For added security, you can encrypt that USB drive using the following guides: <a href="http://computerbeginnersguides.com/blog/2015/09/03/encrypt-a-usb-flash-drive-with-bitlocker-in-windows-10-professional-or-enterprise/" target="_blank">Windows</a> or <a href="http://www.theinstructional.com/guides/encrypt-an-external-disk-or-usb-stick-with-a-password" target="_blank">Mac</a>.</li>
    <li> Print the wallet if you have a printer. Otherwise, write down on a piece of paper your: password, address, and private key (unencrypted). Again, store this as a secure location, separate from your computer and the USB drive.</li>
    <li> Now, if your house burns down you still have a USB drive and a piece of paper. If your HDD crashes, you still have a USB drive and a piece of paper.</li>
    <li> A final reminder: You NEED the private key & password in order to access your account and Ether in the future. We do not save anything to our servers and cannot help you recover your funds if you lose your private key/JSON file and password.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Note: MyEtherWallet can decrypt geth / pre-sale wallets, but geth <strong> cannot </strong> decrypt wallets encrypted by MyEtherWallet. If you plan on not touching a wallet created on MyEtherWallet for a long, long time it may be prudent to save the unencrypted private key / JSON file so you can access it via geth, the official Ethereum GUI wallet, or whatever else is around in the distant future. You can also <a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet" target="_blank"> download the repo </a> and store it with your private keys in order to decrypt in the distant future. See Question #5.</p>

    <li>Doubleclick index.html.</li>
    <li>Generate wallet with a strong password. </li>

    <li>Save the encrypted private key or encrypted JSON. Store it on this airgapped computer that will never access the internet ever.</li>
    <li>Save your address (no need to encrypt) as well. You will need to address to send ETH to yourself later.</li>
    <li>Copy the encrypted private keys and password and address to a USB drive. Encrypt said USB drive. <a href="http://computerbeginnersguides.com/blog/2015/09/03/encrypt-a-usb-flash-drive-with-bitlocker-in-windows-10-professional-or-enterprise/" target="_blank">Windows Instructions</a> & <a href="http://www.theinstructional.com/guides/encrypt-an-external-disk-or-usb-stick-with-a-password" target="_blank">Mac instructions.</a></li>
    <li>Write down the encrypted private key and password on separate pieces of paper. Don't print them because all the printers have insecure wifi these days and store shit and we're being ultra secure here. Triple check that you have written them down correctly. Store these papers in physically separate locations than the USB drives and airgapped computer.</li>
    <li>Go to the view wallet details tab and type in your private key / password from your piece of paper to ensure they are correct and access your wallet. Check that the address you wrote down is the same.</li>
    <li>Refresh that page. And copy/paste your private key or JSON and password from your computer or USB drive to ensure they are correct and can access your wallet. Check that the address you saved on your computer or USB is the same.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Keep in mind, you must prevent loss of the keys and password due to loss or failure of you hard drive failure, or USB drive, or piece of paper. You also must keep in mind physical loss / damage of an entire area (think fire or flood). </p>

  <div class="collapsePanel collapsed">
  <p> Once you have saved and backed up all information <strong> and </strong> verified you have access to your new wallet, you can transfer some Ether to that new wallet.</p>

  <p><strong>Before you start,</strong> If you plan to move a large amount of ether, you should test sending a small amount first to make sure everything goes smoothly. After making the small transaction, it should show up in a blockchain explorer, e.g. <a href="https://www.etherchain.org" target="_blank">https://www.etherchain.org</a>. Make sure that you have access to the address you sent to!</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Navigate to the <a id="send-transaction" class="ptabs" showId="paneSendTrans">"Send Transaction"</a> tab</li>

  <p> Note: Some people have been accidentally typing addresses without the prefix "0x". All addresses start with 0x. Others have been losing characters off the end. We have validation on our site that doesn't allow you to send to addresses without this prefix, and our validation verifies that the address you are sending to is valid. Regardless of any validation measures in place on our site or other sites, ALWAYS BE CAREFUL. DOUBLE CHECK YOUR ADDRESS BEFORE SENDING. PLEASE!</p>

  <h3> <span class="text-primary collapseButton">+</span> 5. How do I run MyEtherWallet.com offline/locally? </h3>
 <div class="collapsePanel collapsed">
  <p> You can run MyEtherWallet.com on your computer instead of from the Github servers. Everything except the "send transaction" tab can be done completely without the internet, so feel free to turn your internet off. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Go here: <a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet" target="_blank">https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet</a></li>
    <li>Click download zip in the upper right.</li>
    <li>Unzip it.</li>
    <li>Doubleclick index.html.</li>
    <li> MyEtherWallet.com is now running entirely on your computer.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> In case you are not familiar, you need to keep the entire folder in order to run it, not just index.html. Don't touch or move anything around in the folder. If you are storing a backup of the MyEtherWallet repo for the distant future, we recommend just storing the ZIP so you can be sure the folder contents stay intact. As we are constantly updating MyEtherWallet.com, we recommend you periodically update your saved version of the repo. The MyEtherWallet team has <strong> no intentions of ever removing this project from Github. As long as Github is around, the repo will be accessible.</strong></p>

  <h3> <span class="text-primary collapseButton">+</span> 6. What happens if your site goes down? </h3>
 <div class="collapsePanel collapsed">
  <p>There seems to be a lot of confusion about what MyEtherWallet does. It's not a web wallet where you put your Ether and we store them for you. You don't have a login and nothing ever gets saved to our servers. It is simply an interface that allows you to do things you normally would do via command line.</p>
  <p>So, if MyEtherWallet goes down, you would have to find another way (like geth) to do what we are doing. But you wouldn't have to "get" your ether out of MyEtherWallet because it's not in MyEtherWallet. It's in whatever wallet your generated via our site.</p>
  <p>In addition, the likelihood of us taking MyEtherWallet down is slim to none. It costs us almost nothing to maintain as we aren't storing any information. If we do take the domain down, it still is, and always will be, publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet" target="_blank">https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet</a>. You can download the ZIP there and run it locally. See question 5. for instructions on how to run locally.</p>

<section class="collapseContainer">
  <h3> <span class="text-primary collapseButton">+</span> 7. So, what is that password thing all about? </h3>
 <div class="collapsePanel collapsed">
  <p>The password that you entered at the very beginning to create a new wallet / account is used to encrypt your private key. This enables you to have a safer version of your private key file.</p>
  <p> Basically, all it means is when you upload your private key file, you will also need to enter the password to decrypt it.</p>
  <p> MyEtherWallet can decrypt geth / pre-sale wallets, but geth <strong> cannot </strong> decrypt wallets encrypted by MyEtherWallet.</p>
  <p> We allow you to save both the encrypted and decrypted private keys / JSON files on MyEtherWallet. If you plan on not touching a wallet created on MyEtherWallet for a long, long time it may be prudent to save the unencrypted private key / JSON file so you can access it via geth, the official Ethereum GUI wallet, or whatever else is around in the distant future.</p>

<section class="collapseContainer">
  <h3> <span class="text-primary collapseButton">+</span> 8. Is using the send transaction offline? </h3>
<div class="collapsePanel collapsed">
  <p> No, the send transaction tab is not offline. It needs the internet in order to send Ether from one wallet to another. However, when you send a transaction, it only sends the signed transaction. Your private key safely stays with you. We also now provide an <a id="offline-transaction" class="ptabs" showId="paneOfflineTrans"> advanced / offline transaction tab</a> so that you may keep your private keys on an offline/airgapped computer.</p>

<section class="collapseContainer">
  <h3> <span class="text-primary collapseButton">+</span> 9. What does "Gas Limit Too Low" Mean?</h3>
<div class="collapsePanel collapsed">
  <p> Most likely, this means you are attempting to send Ether to a contract. Sending to a contract requires a bit more data and therefore a bit more gas.

<div class="collapsePanel collapsed">
  <p> While the mouse moving thing is clever and we understand why people like it, the reality is window.crypto ensures more entropy than your mouse movements. The mouse movements aren't unsafe, we (and tons of other crypto experments) believe in window.crypto. In addition, MyEtherWallet.com can be used on touch devices.

  <h3> <span class="text-primary collapseButton">-</span> Security </h3>
  <div class="collapsePanel">
  <p> One of your first questions is, "Why should I trust these people?" You are probably worried that this site isn't secure. That is a good thing. When dealing with currency and the internet, you should be paranoid. But, let's try to be a bit reasonable.</p>
  <p> At this point, we have not had our code audited. Apparently, it costs a fair bit of money to get code audited. If you or a team you know would be willing to help us out in the auditing department, please let us know. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3hh89n/could_someone_please_audit_ether_wallet/">Here is a reddit thread with another user asking for someone to audit us.</a> Reach out to us on reddit or github or <a id="contact" class="ptabs" showId="paneContact"> where ever</a>.</p>
  <p> Until someone / a group of people take the time to go through the code, here are some things to alleviate any paranoia you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We've been up and running since August 2015. If you search for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum+ethtrader+EtherMining+EthereumProgramming+ethereumprojects+etherpool/search?q=myetherwallet&sort=relevance&t=all" target="_blank" />"myetherwallet" on reddit</a>, you can see numerous people who use us and no complaints or reports of stolen funds.</li>
    <li>We aren't going to take your money or steal your private key(s). There is no malicious code on this site. In fact the "GENERATE WALLET" and "BULK GENERATE" tabs are completely client-side. That means that all the code is executed on <strong> your computer </strong> and it is never sent to the servers or to us or anywhere else in the magical internet land.</li>
    <li> Check the URL -- This site is being served through github and you can see the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet" target="_blank">https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet</a> to the domains: <a href="http://kvhnuke.github.io/etherwallet/" target="_blank">http://kvhnuke.github.io/etherwallet/</a> and <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com" target="_blank">https://www.myetherwallet.com</a> (our new domain with SSL). You can verify it's hosted at github by using <a href="http://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/?domain=myetherwallet.com" target="_blank">http://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/?domain=myetherwallet.com</a> - last two A record IPs are owned by github for their custom domain hosting.</li>
    <li> For generating wallets, you can download the <a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet">source code</a> by using the "DOWNLOAD ZIP" button in the aforementioned link. Then, disconnect your computer from the internet and / or move that .zip file via flash drive to an air-gapped computer. Unzip the file, double-click on "index.html", and you have the exact same thing happening on your air-gapped computer. You can now generate wallets on that computer without fear that we are stealing you heart and soul and first-born child. (Obviously, sending transactions is not going to work without the internet. Sorry!)</li>
    <li> Do a test run and check and see what network activity is happening. The easiest way for you (yes, YOU!) to do this (if you are using Chrome) is to right click on the page and click "inspect element". Now, go to the "Network" tab. Then, generate a wallet. Any wallet, any password&mdash;this is a test, remember. You will see there is no network activity. You may see something happening that looks like data:image/gif and data:image/png. Those are the QR codes being generated...on your computer...by your computer. No bytes were transferred.</li>
    <li> Now, to be safe, move over to the "Resources" tab. Here you can see all the different elements that make up a website. That includes things like the HTML (the base of what you see on the page), images (pretty pictures! Usually in .jpg, .gif, or .png format), the CSS (the stuff that makes the HTML look so pretty), the JS (the stuff that makes the HTML do other stuff, like making QR codes show up when you press Generate), Local Storage (one way of storing things on your local machine), Cookies (yum! Another way for sites to store data on your machine), and caches (yet another way to store stuff on your machine, usually to make things go faster). If you click through Local Storage, Cookies, and Cache, you will see nothing is being stored. Nothing is being saved. Refresh the page and you are back to square one.</li>
    <li> If you do not feel comfortable using this tool, then by all means, do not use it. We created this tool as a helpful way for people to generate wallets and make transactions without needing to dive into command line / geth / etc. Again, feel free to reach out to us at any of the below addresses and we will respond as quickly as possible. Thanks! </li>
