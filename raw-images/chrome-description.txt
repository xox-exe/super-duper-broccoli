REMINDERS
- Ethereum, MyEtherWallet.com & MyEtherWallet CX, and some of the underlying Javascript libraries we use are under active development. While we have tested thoroughly & tens of thousands of wallets have been successfully created by people all over the globe, there is always the remote possibility that something unexpected happens that causes your ETH to be lost. While do everything we can to ensure that this does not happen and are available via email/reddit/twitter to assist in every way we can, this possibility still exists. Please do not invest more than you are willing to lose and please be careful. If something were to happen, we are sorry, but we are not responsible for the lost Ether.
- Please, do not forget to save your private key & password when you create a new wallet. - Back them up in multiple phsyical locations â€“ not just on your computer!
- Please make sure you are sending to the correct address.
- Please reach out to us with any and all feedback you have, especially with things that confuse you or error messages that don't make sense.
